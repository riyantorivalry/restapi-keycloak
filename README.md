# REST API & Keycloak

This is a demo project of REST API secured with Keycloak. Keycloak is an open source identity provider and access management.

At this project, Keycloak is used to secure the REST API by providing authorization and authentication to user. 
I'll update this project for other services provided by Keycloak later, such as access control, hitting other endpoint from other REST API, etc. Insya Allah :)
